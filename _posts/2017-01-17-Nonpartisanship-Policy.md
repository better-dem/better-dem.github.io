title: Nonpartisanship Policy
---

Some of this document was borrowed from the Brookings Institute’s nonpartisanship policy document, [here](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nonpartisanship-Policy.pdf).

## Article I - Summary
Better Democracy Network (BDN) is a nonpartisan organization, and does not participate in partisan political activity. Here are some key points from BDN’s Nonpartisanship policy:
<ul>
<li>BDN creates web services and tools, some of which are intended to be used by appropriate private or public entities to create educational content for the public. These tools must be made reasonably available to any such entity, regardless of their party, ideology, or position on any issue.</li>
<li>You may not use BDN resources for political activity, campaign work, or propaganda.</li>
<li>When you create content for BDN which involves taking a position on some potentially controversial issue, BDN has strict guidelines to ensure transparency and sound research. </li>
<li>All content published using BDN tools is subject to reviews to ensure BDN’s tools are not being misused for propaganda or campaigning purposes, and the public has the right to post complaints, which will be reviewed.</li>
<li>You may privately engage in personal political activity, such as blogging, attending political rallies, signing petitions, and donating to campaigns, so long as you don’t use your BDN affiliation.</li>
</ul>

## Article II - Who This Affects
This policy applies to all BDN directors, employees, and volunteers; hereafter “BDN personnel”.

## Article III - Policy
### Non-exclusive Tools and Services
BDN creates web services and tools (hereafter “BDN tools”). Some BDN tools are intended to be used by appropriate private or public entities to create educational content for the public. These tools must be made reasonably available to any such entity, regardless of their party, ideology, or position on any issue.

### BDN Forbids Campaigning and Propaganda with our Resources
#### Campaigning and Propaganda by BDN Personnel
BDN resources are not to be used for campaigning or propaganda. 
No BDN personnel may distribute or display campaign materials supporting or opposing an active political candidate or political party or otherwise campaign in the BDN workplace or during the course of work for BDN. BDN personnel are forbidden to create campaign or propaganda content using BDN’s tools. 

#### Taking Positions on Issues
Some of the content created by BDN personnel may involve rendering value judgements on some public policy or evaluating the truth or usefulness of some controversial statement by some person or agency (hereafter “taking a position”). This does not constitute propaganda or campaigning. To ensure high standards of objectivity, the following requirements apply to all such cases:
<ul>
<li>Any content which involves taking a position must be supported by research. Citations must be given, sources must be trustworthy, all evidence uncovered in the course of research which is detrimental to the conclusion must be presented or linked to from the publication.</li>
<li>All instances of taking a position must be visually distinct in their published presentation (for example, presented in italics) and accompanied by a visible link to a summary of our nonpartisanship policy.</li>
<li>All instances of taking a position which are likely to be interpreted as partisan or controversial must be accompanied by a note on why the issue may be controversial and why taking a position is still justified. This should in most cases involve citing evidence of a logical fallacy and / or conflict-of-interest in the public discourse surrounding that issue.</li>
<li>Content items (such as an article or post) may not have the primary purpose of persuading viewers to take a potentially controversial position. All content must be primarily educational.</li>
<li>No BDN person may systematically or disproportionately take the same controversial position across multiple content items unless it is appropriate given the topic assignments and projects.</li>
<li>All published content written by BDN personnel must be self-reviewed for instances of taking a position</li>
<li>All published content must be reviewed by an editor for compliance with our taking positions policy. If any problems are found, the editor must correct them or reject the content. If the content is not rejected, the process must be repeated until the content is rejected or approved without modification or BDN runs out of editors, at which point the content is automatically rejected as too controversial.</li>
</ul>

In addition to these general policies, specific content initiatives which may commonly involve taking a position must have an initiative-specific policy for ensuring nonpartisanship and transparency in positions taken. BDN personnel must follow these specific policies.

#### Campaigning and Propaganda by Third Party Users of BDN Tools

Some of BDN’s tools allow “third parties” (public officials, candidates, and other private entities) to create content to be published on BDN’s tools to the public. All such content must primarily serve an educational purpose, and not primarily further the private interest of the third parties.

Use of these tools will be governed by Terms of Use, and must not include campaign messaging. We forbid messages such as the following:
<ul>
<li>Explicit campaign promises</li>
<li>Criticisms of opponents unrelated to the specific educational purpose of the tool</li>
<li>Requests for volunteers or donations, or links to pages whose primary content is a request for donations or volunteers</li>
<li>Instructions on which way to vote</li>
<li>Instructions to perform other political activity (such as attending a rally or mailing a representative)</li>
</ul>


### Auditing Use and Responding to Problems
All content will have a plainly-visible “report campaigning or propaganda” button, which redirects users to a web form where they can submit a complaint. Within the limits of BDN’s resources, all reported campaigning and propaganda will be investigated by an editor, prioritizing content which has multiple plausible complaint reports.

Problems will be responded to differently if the content in question was generated by BDN personnel versus third parties.

#### Problematic Third Party Content
Third party content that is found to be controversial will be visibly flagged as such, and editors will comment on the source of controversy. Such content will not be removed, but will be retained so long as it, in addition to the highly-visible comments from the editors about its problematic nature, constitutes a useful piece of educational material. The third party will be permitted to edit the content to correct the problem, subject to BDN editor review.

Third parties who repeatedly violate our terms of use will be restricted from generating content for a period of time commensurate to the frequency and severity of such violations. Content which severely violates our terms will be removed from the site.

#### Problematic BDN Personnel Content
Content generated by BDN personnel that is found to be controversial will be removed. 

BDN personnel who repeatedly violate our policy will be restricted from generating content for a period of time commensurate to the frequency and severity of such violations. Content which severely violates our terms will be removed from the site, and the person will be disciplined appropriately.

### Private Political Activity
This policy does not affect the ability for BDN personnel to engage in political activity in a private capacity. Political activity which may constitute a conflict of interest should be reported to BDN, and a restriction from any editorial duties related to the person’s political interest will be put in place for the duration of their involvement. 

This policy does not impact the rights of BDN personnel to vote for any candidate or issue. BDN personnel may also engage in other forms of personal political activities so long as they do not use their BDN affiliation when doing so. These include:
<ul>
<li>Contributing money to a candidate, political party, political action committee or political cause</li>
<li>Working on a non-partisan basis to register voters, help operate a polling station, or count votes</li>
<li>Registering for a political party or as an “independent”</li>
<li>Signing nominating petitions to support getting a candidate or an issue on the ballot</li>
<li>Attending a political rally or participating in a demonstration or protest.</li>
<li>BDN personnel may sign a statement endorsing or opposing a candidate. The letter may only include the person’s title or affiliation with BDN if it also contains language indicating that affiliations are provided for identification purposes only and do not indicate BDN’s support.</li>
</ul>
