title: 501(c)(3)!
---

Just this week we obtained our IRS determination letter, and Better Democracy Network is officially a federally recognized 501(c)(3) public charity nonprofit!
This has always been the plan, and now the paperwork has caught up with reality.

We're very excited for what this means for our organization.
<ul>
<li>[Your donations](https://www.demportal.org/donate/) are now tax deductable.</li>
<li>We can now seek grants from foundations to support our work.</li>
<li>A wide array of other benefits such as discounted software and services is open to us.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for all your support along the way!
