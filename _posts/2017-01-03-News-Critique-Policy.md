title: News Critique Policy
---

Much of the television news which Americans consume is created for profit or propaganda purposes.
Though most reputable organizations don't present outright lies as fact, there are aspects of the tone and content which leave viewers with misimpressions.
With our news critique video series, our goal is to educate viewers on how to interpret TV news in order to live happy healthy lives and to participate effectively in the democratic process.

In critiquing news segments of a political nature, Better Dem strives to be as objective, transparent, and non-partisan as possible in keeping with our educational mission.
This blog post explains our news segment critique process.

## Segment Selection

In selecting which news segments to critique, there is an opportunity for bias.
Since we are critiquing these segments, that gives a negative impression of the news organizations themselves.
We neither endorse nor oppose any news organization whose segments we critique.
We do not claim that any segment, regardless of its quality, is a representative sample from the overall content of the organization who produced it.

We visit major outlets' websites and view videos which they post of their own reporting.
We select segments which exhibit instructive flaws in tone and substance.
We seek variety in topic and news source.

## Analyzing Content

We outline every segment to try to present all statements in their intended context.
We point out implicit logical falacies in the reporting, such as balance falacies presenting two unequally-substantiated viewpoints as if they are equal.
We fact-check cited sources to the best of our ability.

### Fact-Checking

We rely on non-partisan resources such as government websites for our fact-checking efforts.
When we render a false judgment on some claim, we provide sources and describe our reasoning.

## Analyzing Tone

We analyze selection of words, emphasis, demeanor, imagery, etc. and describe how they create a tone for a news segment.
We present alternative wordings, emphasis, etc. to contrast with a more neutral presentation of the same information. 

## Corrections

If you see any errors in our material, please report them to info@betterdem.org.
We keep a correction history at the bottom of every post.
