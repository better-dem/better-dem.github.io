title: Tools for Civics Educators
---

Better Dem is pleased to announce our free platform for Civics educators and students.
We hope our tools help teachers to teach research skills, data fluency, and critical thinking for political problems.
Our content is appropriate for students from high school upper classmen through college.

These tools have <b>power</b> and <i>flexibility</i>.
Our full library of digital content is available for instructors to embed in their assignments, allowing them to build custom assignments on local, state, or national issues.
Check out an example assignment <a href="https://www.demportal.org/apps/reading_assignment/participate/877159">here</a>.
