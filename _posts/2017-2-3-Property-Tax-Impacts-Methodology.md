title: Property Tax Impacts of Maple Valley Prop. 1 - Methodology
---

This article describes the methodology we used to make [our predictions](http://demportal.org) for the fiscal impacts of the new property tax proposed by [Maple Valley Prop. 1](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/whats-on-the-ballot/ballot-measures/february-special/list-of-measures/maple-valley.aspx).
We presented the impacts as "Percent of Income Spent on Housing", because we thought this would be the most useful variable for voters to broadly understand the impacts of this measure on their community.
This is our first foray into policy predictions, and our numbers for this measure should be interpreted as a best effort on short notice, not as highly-reliable.
Any official city estimates which contradict our predictions should be preferred over ours.

The [election website](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/whats-on-the-ballot/ballot-measures/february-special/list-of-measures/maple-valley.aspx) included an estimate that the tax rate would be increased by $0.35 per $1000 of home value.
The difficulty we faced is that exact income and home values are not publicly available to do this calculation.
So, our method was basically two steps:
<ul>
<li>Jointly estimate incomes and home values</li>
<li>Compute fiscal impact given estimated home values and incomes</li>
</ul>

## Data Sources

### King County Election Website

The [election website](http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/whats-on-the-ballot/ballot-measures/february-special/list-of-measures/maple-valley.aspx) included an estimate that the tax rate would be increased by $0.35 per $1000 of home value.

### 2015 American Community Survey Data (Produced Annually by Census Bureau)
We used data from the following two pages:
<ul>
<li>[Employment and income information for Maple Valley](https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP03/1600000US5343150)</li>
<li>[Housing information for Maple Valley](https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/15_5YR/DP04/1600000US5343150)</li>
</ul>

We used the 2015 ACS because the 2016 results aren't available yet at the time of our analysis - we made no attempt to extrapolate 2016 numbers.

### 2015 Maple Valley Final Budget

We used the [2015 Maple Valley Final Budget](http://www.maplevalleywa.gov/home/showdocument?id=7826) property tax rate of $1.25 / $1000.
