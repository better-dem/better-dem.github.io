title: Tool Review Policy
---

With our tool review video series, our primary goal is to aggregate useful web tools and demonstrate how to use them.
Additionally, we want to educate our viewers on how to evaluate information sources, which viewers can generalize to other sites they might encounter on the Internet.
In evaluating tools with a political nature, Better Dem strives to be as objective, transparent, and non-partisan as possible in keeping with our educational mission.
This blog post explains our rating process for our tool review videos.

## Overview

We give "star" ratings from 0 to 5, rounding to the nearest half star.
We use the following 15 criteria to evaluate the tools:

|Criterion|
|-----------|
|**Usefulness**|
|Contains information which is interesting to average citizens?|
|Has depth of features beyond the initial impression?|
|Easy to navigate?|
|Easy to interpret?|
|Data well categorized?|
|No glaring interface bugs?|
|**Accuracy**|
|Visualization correct?|
|Data correct?|
|Trustworthy sources?|
|Sources Recent?|
|**Transparency**|
|Cites sources?|
|Links to source of data?|
|Links to further reading?|
|Raw numbers available?|
|Description of what the numbers mean?|

For each criterion, a scorer gives a 0 if in their view the criterion is not met, and a 1 if it is met.
Due to time constraints, our evaluations are only somewhat thorough; for example, all data can't be verified for accuracy.
If the scorer doesn't have time to reasonably determine whether the criterion is met, they don't include it in their scoring.
The star rating is determined by adding up the scores for all scored criteria, dividing by the number of criteria included, multiplying by 5, then rounding to the nearest 1/2.

## Example

For example, imagine the rubric filled out for tool X below:

|Criterion|Score|
|-----------|:-:|
|**Usefulness**| |
|Contains information which is interesting to average citizens?|1|
|Has depth of features beyond the initial impression?|0|
|Easy to navigate?|1|
|Easy to interpret?|1|
|Data well categorized?|1|
|No glaring interface bugs?|1|
|**Accuracy**| |
|Visualization correct?|1|
|Data correct?|*NA*|
|Trustworthy sources?|1|
|Sources Recent?|0|
|**Transparency**| |
|Cites sources?|1|
|Links to source of data?|0|
|Links to further reading?|0|
|Raw numbers available?|0|
|Description of what the numbers mean?|1|

The reviewer didn't have time, or couldn't follow the sources back to the data to determine whether it was correct, so "Data correct?" was excluded from the rating.

The final score is calculated as follows:
```
8 / 14 * 5 = 2.857
Rounding 2.857 to the nearest .5 gives 3.0, and a final score of 3 stars out of 5.
```

## Controversy

As we mentioned earlier, in evaluating tools with a political nature, Better Dem strives to be as objective, transparent, and non-partisan as possible in keeping with our educational mission.
Most of the tools we anticipate reviewing are relatively uncontroversial - they simply present data.
In this case, we only require one reviewer.
If the video producer determines that the tool under review is potentially controversial, two reviewers will independently score the tool.
If the scores are within one star, the average will be presented (rounded to the nearest half star), and the fact that two raters were involved will be disclosed.
If the two scores are not within one star, no rating will be given, and the two differing scores will be disclosed in the review.
