title: Journalist Tools: Budget Transparency
---

Since we started less than 6 months ago, Better Dem has been building tools to help ordinary citizens understand and engage with their government.
Local nonprofit news organizations are made up of talented and dedicated journalists who work for bread crumbs or less to benefit their communities.
Today, we released our Journalist Portal, a platform embedded in the Better Democracy Portal which allows journalists to use our tools to create interactive, informative content for the web, for FREE.

We're starting by sharing our budget transparency tool, which we <a href="https://www.demportal.org/kirkland_budget">recently demoed for Kirkland, WA</a>.

We're very excited to pilot this with nonprofit news orgs, so spread the word, and check out the video below!
