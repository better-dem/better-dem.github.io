title: Ballot Decision Tool Beta - Maple Valley Prop. 1
---

We're pleased to announce the release of our Ballot Decision tool beta, just (barely) in time for Maple Valley Washington's Prop. 1.
If you're in Maple Valley and haven't made up your mind yet, please [check out the tool!](http://demportal.org/mv_prop_1)

## Who is this For?

The intended audience for the ballot decision tool is pretty much any voter who can use a computer.
If you're a complete novice, the tool is intended to ease you into the issues behind a ballot measure in an engaging way.
If you're opinionated and informed, the tool still offers unique content you can't find anywhere else and links to deeper research.

## Isn't this Just a Ballotpedia Rip-off?

[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org) is an amazing website which we at BDN have great admiration for.
In addition to their encyclopedic content about the nuts and bolts of American democracy, their ballot measure information pages are an outstanding resource.
Our ballot decision tool tries to expand on the ideas behind ballotpedia ballot measure pages, and provide a user experience that draws people in.
For comparison with our tool, check out [this recent ballotpedia article](https://ballotpedia.org/City_of_Seattle_Transportation_Property_Tax_Levy,_Proposition_No._1_(November_2015)) on a municipal ballot measure which was similar to Maple Valley Prop. 1. 

Features of a Ballotpedia municipal ballot information page:
<ul>
<li>"In plain English" explanation of the measure</li>
<li>Restatement of arguments for and against from the official county election page</li>
<li>Path to the ballot - a history of ammendments and who proposed what</li>
</ul>

We think our ballot decision tool stands out because of its engaging interface, financial projections, and the decision aspect itself.

### Engaging Interface

Our ballot decision page has a simple hierarchical organization that lets visitors quickly understand what's there and navigate to what interests them.

The tool's outline shows three sections for quick navigation.

Throughout the decision tool we use a variety of interactive widgets, such as the single quiz widget, the effects chart widget, and the decision widget.
Compared to an all-text article, these are intended to keep more visitors interested and to encourage active thinking about the question posed by the ballot measure.

### Financial Effects

The financial burden a new tax puts on a community is difficult to understand.
In the case of Maple Valley Prop. 1, the city made available the median projected tax burden, the expected tax rate, and a projection of the tax burden's slight variations over the next 20 years.
These were published as numbers buried within text, and a table within a pdf file accessible from a link in the city's website.

We believe that citizens shouldn't have to dig or do math to get a reasonable understanding of the fiscal impact of a ballot measure.
We took census data and information from the city website to make our own financial projections (follow our methodology [here](http://betterdem.org/Property-Tax-Impacts-Methodology/)).
The result is a set of interactive charts where users can see the expected changes to property tax and to housing costs as a percentage of income depending on the vote result.

By clicking between "yes" or "no" and clicking on the charts themselves, users can see how the measure will affect different people in their community.

### The Decisionator

The last step of being an informed voter is making the decision.
Our ballot tool provides a simple interface for assigning importance to several arguments for and against the measure and generating a decision.
This tool encourages users to consider arguments that they may have ignored on their own, and encourages a decision-making process which goes from arguments to decision, instead of working backward (rationalizing).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/better-dem/better-dem.github.io/master/images/ballot_decider/decision1.png" height='300'>
To make their decision, users visually score several arguments for and against the measure.

The decision tool sums up the user's priorities and generates an outcome and an explanation.


## What's Next?

We plan to coninue to make improvements and use this tool for a larger number of elections later this year.
We see the following as the most important areas for improvement:

<ul>
<li>Engage with city officials well in advance of the election to make sure we can do accurate projections and have the tool be widely distributed</li>
<li>Iterate on the user experience to make sure the tool serves citizens with varying levels of knowledge and interest</li>
</ul>
