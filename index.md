### Our Mission

The Better Democracy Network (BetterDem) is an organization of software engineers and social scientists trying to improve the connection between citizens and their government.

BetterDem's activities include:
 - We create educational content about how to interact with government at local, state, and federal levels.
 - We provide ordinary citizens with free and personalized recommendations for events, tools, and other opportunities to participate in government.
 - We create free and open-source software and provide free and low-cost web services to facilitate interaction between citizens and their government.
 - We perform scientific research on citizen engagement and informedness.
 - We advocate for more and better opportunities for citizens to meaningfully participate in government.
