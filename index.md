### Our Mission

Better Democracy is a network of software engineers and social scientists trying to increase the quality and frequency of engagement between citizens and their government.

We have ongoing projects related to budget transparency and land use community outreach, as well as a project to aggregate and provide how-to guides to existing tools for participation.
More coming soon!
