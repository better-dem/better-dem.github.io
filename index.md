### Our Mission

Better Democracy is a network of software engineers and social scientists dedicated to improving the quality of democracy. 
We mobilize our software team on projects with goals such as increasing voter knowledge and decision-making ability, fostering democratic attitudes such as openness to opposing points of view, and improving government accessibility and accountability.
We perform scientific research to better understand the results of our efforts and to contribute to the body of knowledge that will empower future democracy advocates.
We plan to incorporate as a California and federal nonprofit in the next couple months.
