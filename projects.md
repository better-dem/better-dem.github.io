We work on projects with goals such as increasing voter knowledge and decision-making ability, fostering democratic attitudes such as openness to opposing points of view, and improving government accessibility and accountability.


### Better Democracy Portal

The Better Democracy Portal is our flagship project.
For private citizens, the portal is a great resource for learning about and interacting with all levels of government.
For public managers, the portal provides tools for community outreach.
The portal will be online for public consumption in the near future!
